# MolLaserCoolSimulations

## Welcome to the Diatomic Laser Cooling Simulations Documentation!

### Information

This python software includes two different programs:

1. Molecular Dynamics Simulation Code

   - The first code only uses pre-defined constants (like the dipole matrix, hyperfine freqs, g-factors, â€¦) from a .json file.
   - With these the dynamics via the rate or optical Bloch equations can be calculated.

2. Molecular Spectra Calculation Code

   - In comparison, the second code only uses constants of the effective Hamiltonian and Quantum numbers of the level structure.
   - By diagonalizing the Hamiltonians, the electric dipole matrix or branching ratios can be calculated to simulate molecular spectra.
     - With this comes alse hyperfine frequencies, g-factors, ... which are needed for the dynamics simulation code.
